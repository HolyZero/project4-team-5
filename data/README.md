# Project: Movies
### Data folder
Data we used contain:

1.Amazon movies reviews data, link:http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html

2.A movie rating database from Twitter,link:https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings

3.Oscar nomination list from 1997 to 2012

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.
