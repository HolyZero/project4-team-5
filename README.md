# Project 4 Mining Amazon Movies Reviews
### Using Amazon Movie Reviews to Analyze Oscar Nominations for Best Picture

Term: Spring 2016
Group Members: Bob Minnich, Rong Wang, Aoyuan Liao, Josh Dillon, Ziyue Jin

### Project Summary
For our project we wanted to explore the Amazon Movies data set with a focus on the Oscars. We thought that this would be an interesting area to explore and try to determine if we can find any subpopulations of the movies by using graph theory as our distance metric. Using a netowork allows us to create distance matrices that can allow analysis for clustering and recommendations. Based on the analysis, we built a recommendation engine by Shiny App. We also wanted to determine if we could predict the winner of Best Picture based on the Amazon dataset.
